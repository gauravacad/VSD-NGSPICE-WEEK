- Simulate an NMOS device, sweeping (Vds) for diAerent (Vgs), to observe linear and saturation regions 
-  Plot ( Id) vs. (Vds) curves

# Need of spice simulation 
Example of buffer with some values of output loads in femto farad (fF).

**Screenshot:** The table used to extract the delay value based on input slew i.e. 40 ps and assumed total cap at node A of a Buffer as 60 fF.

- Though the value are not taken exactly from row 2 and column 3-4. hence the exact delay is not available.
- So, we donâ€™t need to run the spice simulation, as we have delay table that taking Input slew vs output load with the drive strengths / W/L ratios levels.
- 
## Some requirement of Spice simulation based on typical questions 
- What is the source of table, How the characterization is done and these number are coming from and are different.
- Are these delay models are accurate coz they are going in our chip circuit design and therefore we need to do the matching in simulaton.
- What ever we are doing in STA can be trusted or not? So need spice to verify?
- So it involves characterization of N-P mos transistor and derive the I and vds of transistor and delay of these N or P mos when connected in different fasions.
  ### Circuit design and Spice Simulation 
- `Circuit design` : We try to understand that what king of N or P Mos transistor are connected in certain fasion resulting in a different Logic e.g. `And gate` etc.
- `Spice Simulation`: The above particlaur circuit posses certain characteristics i.e. NMos or PMos which actually decide the delay and decides W/L ratio and thereby drain current and the Vout-Vin curve.
**Ans** is `Spice Simulation`

## Basic Element of Circuit design 

**Screenshot:** The Basic NMos strucutre and PMos is just invert of it.

### Thershold voltage 
- We first ground all the terminals and what we extract are PN juncition behaviour back to back connected
- Nothing is `ON`, Channel has high resistance , no conduction and this is called Source

- Now we will apply small potential at the Gate, this essentially menas that all the ploysilicon area forms capacitor with +ve charge.
