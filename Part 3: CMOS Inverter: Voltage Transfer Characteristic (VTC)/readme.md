# Objective 
- Build a CMOS inverter (PMOS + NMOS) 
- Sweep input, plot ( V{out} ) vs. ( V{in} ) 
- Identify the switching threshold ( Vm ) (point where ( V{in} = V{out} ))

## Spice deck 
- Give a Connectivity information about the netlist including NMOS and PMOS with the substrate unlike a single Device netlist we did in part 1 spice deck.
- Cout that is load capacitance we have theory behind it How the value is derived, but to make current things simple assuming we are in static chacteristics we assume    it to 10 pf. More relative details we will read in dynamic charcteristics.
- Further we make it simple assuming same W/L for both NMOS and PMOS unlike in practics the NMOS W/L is 2-3x bigger than NMOS.

- By zooming we can say switching threshold for W/L ration around 0.87. We learn how to plot the switching threshold.

### Transient Analyis

## Static behavior evaluation ‚Äì CMOS inverter robustness ‚Äì Switching Threshold

### Let's Draw the Spice Model Load curve for Two Different W/L ratio 

- The first figure idicator (circle) is in middle of the axis whereas the other one it is shifted to right. What we Observe? Cmos is a robust-device
- We will observe the same in Day-3 Spice models. Let's Do that and later we write the observations

### observation 
- At this critical area when both are likely "ON" their is high possibility of leakage current too. But the Vm for the two different W/L is different.
- At this condition the current is equal but the direct is differnt **Vgs=Vds** or **Vin=Vout** , `Idsp=-IdsN` boundary condition.
- Want to calucalte or derive anlytic condition to observe early Vm or W/L to fetch either to achieve certain objective of (I,V)
- As we know that at this critical juncture the `Idsp= -Idsn` which means simply => `Idsp + Idsn =0` **(KCL)** Vm totally depends on these values.
- Our next analysis is we take `(1)` **W/L known values to approximate the Vm** and `(2)` **We take a Vm to approximate the ratio W/L**

``` bash
# MOSFET Current Equations
## Kirchhoff's Current Law
I_dsp + I_dsn = 0
## Drain Current Equations
### NMOS Drain Current
I_d = Œºn ¬∑ C_ox ¬∑ (W/L) ¬∑ [[(V_gs - V_t) ¬∑ V_dsat] - (V_dsat¬≤/2)]
### NMOS (Body Effect) AS CMOS will have substitution of Vth for Both P and N Mos
I_dsn = k_n ¬∑ [[(V_m - V_t) ¬∑ V_dsatn] - (V_dsatn¬≤/2)]
### PMOS (Body Effect)
I_dsp = k_p ¬∑ [[(V_m - V_dd - V_t) ¬∑ V_dsatp] - (V_dsatp¬≤/2)]
### using KCL we will solve to evalate Vm
```

### First **W/L known values to approximate the Vm**
```
# Solving for V_m
V_m = R ¬∑ V_dd / (1 + R)
Where: gain factor
R = (K_p ¬∑ V_dsatp) / (K_n ¬∑ V_dsatn) = [(W_p / L_p) ¬∑ K_p' ¬∑ V_dsatp] / [(W_n / L_n) ¬∑ K_n' ¬∑ V_dsatn]
```

### Conversely We derive the size of W and L of transistor from Vm

```
(W_p / L_p) / (W_n / L_n) = [K_n' ¬∑ V_dsatn ¬∑ [(V_m - V_t)] - (V_dsatn¬≤/2)] / [K_p' ¬∑ V_dsatp ¬∑ [(-V_m + V_dd + V_t)] + (V_dsatp¬≤/2)]
```

## Delay vs Sizing Trade-offs

| Wp/Lp | x.Wn/Ln | Rise delay | Fall delay | Vm    |
|-------|---------|------------|------------|-------|
| Wp/Lp | Wn/Ln   | 148ps      | 71ps       | 0.99v |
| Wp/Lp | 2Wn/Ln  | 80ps       | 76ps       | 1.2v  |
| Wp/Lp | 3Wn/Ln  | 57ps       | 80ps       | 1.25v |
| Wp/Lp | 4Wn/Ln  | 45ps       | 84ps       | 1.35v |
| Wp/Lp | 5Wn/Ln  | 37ps       | 88ps       | 1.4v  |

## Key Observations

### 1. **Balanced Delay Point (Wp/Lp = 2Wn/Ln)**
- **Rise delay ‚âà Fall delay** (80ps ‚âà 76ps)
- Approximately equal propagation delays in both directions
- **Optimal for clock synthesis buffers** where symmetrical delay is critical
- Switching threshold (Vm) = 1.2v ‚âà Vdd/2 (assuming Vdd ‚âà 2.4v)

### 2. **Rise Delay Optimization (Higher x values)**
- As NMOS width increases (x = 3, 4, 5), rise delay decreases significantly
- However, fall delay increases proportionally
- Trade-off: Faster rising edge at the cost of slower falling edge

### 3. **Switching Threshold (Vm) Shift**
- Vm increases from 0.99v to 1.4v as NMOS width increases
- Wider NMOS pulls Vm higher (closer to Vdd)
- Standard ratio (x=1) gives Vm ‚âà 0.99v (unbalanced, favors PMOS)

### 4. **Application-Specific Design Guidelines**

#### **Clock Buffers (Clock Tree Synthesis)**
- **Recommended ratio: Wp/Lp = 2Wn/Ln**
- Symmetrical rise/fall delays minimize clock skew
- Balanced switching threshold reduces jitter sensitivity
- Critical for clock distribution networks

#### **Data Path Buffers**
- **Can use asymmetric sizing** based on critical path
- If falling edge is critical: Use x = 1 (faster fall delay: 71ps)
- If rising edge is critical: Use x = 4 or 5 (faster rise delay: 45ps, 37ps)
- Trade-off speed for the non-critical transition

#### **General Logic Gates**
- Standard ratio (x=1) acceptable for non-critical paths
- Use x=2 for better noise margins (Vm ‚âà Vdd/2)
- Higher x values increase input capacitance (loading effect)

### 5. **Power and Area Considerations**
- Larger transistor widths increase:
  - Gate capacitance (higher dynamic power)
  - Leakage current (higher static power)
  - Silicon area
- **x=2 ratio offers best performance/power/area balance** for most applications

### 6. **Design Trade-offs Summary**
- **x=1**: Unbalanced, fastest fall, smallest area
- **x=2**: Balanced delays, optimal for clocks, good noise margin
- **x‚â•3**: Fast rise, slow fall, larger area/power
