# Objective 
- Sweep (Vgs) vs. ( Id ) and extract threshold ( Vt ) (e.g. by linear extrapolation) 
- Observe eAects of velocity saturation in short-channel regime

## CMOS voltage transfer characteristics (VTC) 
- Naming conventions for simplicity and model design
- Complementary to each other hence CMOS.
### With few observation:
- `Vgsn = Vin-Vss(=0)` = `Vin` restricitng to Nmos discussion for our understanding and lowering the PMos complexity.
-  `Vdsn = `Vout`
-  Vgsp= `Vin-vdd`
-  Vdsp= `Vout-Vdd`
  
**Screentshot:** Showing naming convetion for study and (II) figure showing when the Nmos will be `ON`

- **Observation** Current is negative due to direction
-  Idsp= -Idsn these paremeters are enough to define the **N/Pmos IdsN  vs VdsN** curve
